## Abstract
[Manubot](https://manubot.org/) is a tool for collaboratively authoring and editing scientific manuscripts on GitHub. It uses the simple formatting language called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), in which, for example, **bold text** is indicated by double asterisks and *italic text* is indicated by single asterisks. You can add superscripts (x^2^) and subscripts (H~2~O), as well as ~~strikethrough text~~, hyperlinks, and more. 

Authors and collaborators can contribute to a project either by editing the document files on the GitHub web site or by cloning the repository to their own computer, editing the text there, and submitting a GitHub 'pull request'. Casey Greene -- whose lab first developed Manubot to manage a [review of deep learning](https://greenelab.github.io/deep-review/) -- added the following text to this document via [pull request](https://github.com/jperkel/mymanuscript/pull/1): 

>Let's add a citation by persistent identifier. This is my favorite feature of Manubot [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128]. It will also give you a chance to review a pull request.

Greene's pull request added a reference to the original Manubot paper using just the DOI -- a feature called 'cite-by-identifier'. Citations can also be added using arXiv or PubMed IDs, URLs, and [other identifiers](https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review/#tbl:citations). Here we'll add a second reference by DOI. [@doi:10.1038/d41586-019-03632-y]. Note the tooltip that appears if you mouse over the inline references, which reveals the PubMed ID, among other information. As this particular reference is actually cited twice in the article, you should also see navigation arrows that allow you to jump to each location.
