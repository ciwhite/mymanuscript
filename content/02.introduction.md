## Introduction

[Manubot](https://manubot.org/) is a tool for collaboratively authoring and editing scientific manuscripts. It marries the scientific writing process with the workflow of open-source software development, much of which occurs on GitHub, and at least 30 articles have been published online using the tool (Figure @fig:manubot-fig).

Authors and collaborators can contribute to a project either by editing the document files on the GitHub web site or by cloning the repository to their own computer and editing the text there. In either case, changes are submitted in the form of a GitHub 'pull request', which allows the project maintainers to review the proposed edits. 

Casey Greene -- whose lab first developed Manubot to manage a [review of deep learning](https://greenelab.github.io/deep-review/) -- added the following text to this document via [pull request](https://github.com/jperkel/mymanuscript/pull/1): 

>Let's add a citation by persistent identifier. This is my favorite feature of Manubot [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128]. It will also give you a chance to review a pull request.

Greene's pull request added a reference to the original Manubot paper using just its DOI -- a feature called 'cite-by-identifier'. Citations can also be added using arXiv [@arxiv:1906.11238] or PubMed IDs [@pmid:32015508], URLs [@url:https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00655-8], and [other identifiers](https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review/#tbl:citations). Here we'll add a second reference by DOI. [@doi:10.1038/d41586-019-03632-y]. Note the tooltip that appears if you mouse over the inline references, which provides a direct link to the PubMed record, among other information. As this particular reference is actually cited twice in this article, you should also see navigation arrows that allow you to jump to each location.

Manubot builds documents from text files written in the simple formatting language called [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), in which, for example, **bold text** is indicated by double asterisks and *italic text* is indicated by single asterisks. You can add superscripts (x^2^) and subscripts (H~2~O), as well as ~~strikethrough text~~, hyperlinks, and more.
